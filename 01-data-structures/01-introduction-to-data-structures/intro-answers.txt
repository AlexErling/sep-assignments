Questions:
1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?

Line answers:
1. The data structure used is an array which simulates the line.
  It allows the developer to go and perform these tasks:
  - add a person to the back of the line
  - remove someone from the line
  - search for a person in the line
  - find the first, last, and middle person in the line.
  - find the location of someone in the line

2. As, the elements in the data structure represent people.
   The developer would use the search(person)function to find a specific element.

3. While we are using this for an amusement park, this could represent most real world scenarios that includes
   a list where that items can be added to added or removed.
   EX. Restaurants, line at the DMV, a to-do list.


Screen answers:
1. The data structured used is an (x,y) matrix from an array or arrays.
   The developer can set pixel positions within the matrix.

2. An element in this structure would be a location in the matrix, so that could use the at(x, y) to find the corresponding x and y array.

3. This structure could be used for data that requires a structured matrix that has X and Y coordinates
   This could include being graphing, or games like Battleship, or Connect Four.
